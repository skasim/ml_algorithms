# ML Algorithms

A collection of ML Algorithms written from scratch from academic papers as praxis.

## Algorithms
1. Two layer MLP written in Numpy 
2. Three Layer MLP written in Numpy
3. Classifying the Iris dataset with MLP written in Numpy
4. Classifying MNIST with model written in Numpy
5. PyTorch classification model for MNIST ([paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=WLN3QrAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=WLN3QrAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC))
6. Visualization of the hidden layer for MNIST classification
7. PyTorch CNN applied to CIFAR dataset visualizing feature maps and activations
8. MultiLayer RNN Encoder-Decoder with GRU layer and GRU cell implemented from scratch
9. RNN with GRU implemented from scratch for German to English translation task ([paper](https://aclanthology.org/attachments/D14-1179.Attachment.pdf))
10. A different RNN GRU implementation of [Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoderâ€“Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078)
11. RNN Search implementation of [Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Aligh and Translate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473) for German to English translation task. This paper added attention to RNNs
12. Implemenation of [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). That is, the paper that did away with RNNs entirely and kept attention and introduced the transformer for German to English translation task
